    <h3> Celine's Life</h3>   

<p>
    My name is Celine Wang. I am a <strong> dual major </strong> in advertising and information technologies. I am a <strong> Newhouse Leadership Scholar </strong> with a high academic standing on the Dean's List. I have successfully developed three short films in my screenwriting class using my personal experiences which challenged me to analyze my personal life and turn it into a piece of art.  I also have been an active member of an International Charitable group known as Zonta Club, which I created birthing kits for African women who cannot access medical facilities.

    With my free time, I recently have been watching Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead with my best friends. I care a lot about mental and physical health and truly believe you cannot have one and not the other, so I try to balance everything I have going on in my life. I love to lift five to six times a week to stay physically fit, plus I love the extra endorphins I receive. Personally, I also love food, I appreciate all different types of cultures of food plus I love to cook as well as eat, so I am always looking for the next healthy alternative option.

    Personally, I also love food, I appreciate all different types of cultures of food plus I love to cook as well as eat, so I am always looking for the next healthy alternative option. Because I love to participate in many activities, what I have learned over the last few years is being organized and time efficient is key. Writing down the activities I plan on doing and the times I plan on doing them has helped me become the less stressful person I am today. I truly believe if we put enough effort into the things that we love such as ourselves, we can find satisfaction and fulfillment.
